- 1 1/4 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 2 cups flour
  - Mom only uses 1 1/2 cup, but I like cakier cookies

- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 (6 oz.) package semi-sweet chocolate chips (1 cup)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375.
2. Beat shortening, brown sugar, milk and vanilla in large bowl with mixer on medium speed until well blended. Beat in egg. Combine flour, salt and baking soda. Mix into shortening mixture until just blended. Stir in chocolate chips.
3. Using two small spoons, create small balls of dough on cookie sheet. Leave about 3 inches in between balls.
4. Bake 8 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool completely.
