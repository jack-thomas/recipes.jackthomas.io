## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1 cup flour
- 3/4 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup raspberry jam
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar

## Directions

1. Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add in eggs, vanilla, lemon, and lemon zest. Add in flour, almond flour, and salt, and beat until just combined.
2. Gather dough in ball then roll to 1/4" thick. Use a 3" cookie cutter to cut out 12 cookies, then stamp out 12 stars in center of each cookie. Gather all scraps and re-roll using a bit more flour if the dough is sticky. Stamp out 12 more cookies (without cutting out the center). Chill all cutouts for at least an hour.
3. Bake at 350F for 8-10 minutes. Cool completely.
4. Simmer raspberry jam on low heat 5-7 minutes, until reduced by 1/3. Spread onto cookies **without** the cutout. Sift powdered sugar cookies unto cookies **with** the cutout before you assemble.

So... We made a test batch of these today. They *tasted* pretty good, but we ended up needing **way** more flour (like three times as much). We certainly need to make another test batch, for which we're thinking that we should start with 1 cup of almond flour and 2 cups of all-purpose flour. Regardless, we definitely need to do another test batch, as our process today will not be easy to replicate.

Great! Wet dough. Use lots of flour when rolling.
