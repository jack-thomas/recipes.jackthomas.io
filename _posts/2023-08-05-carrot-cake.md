## Ingredients

### Cake Ingredients

- Nonstick vegetable oil spray
- 1/4 cup golden raisins
- 1 1/2 Tablespoons bourbon
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans
- 6 Tablespoons (3/8 cup) vegetable oil
- carrot mixture
    - 1/2 pound carrots, peeled, coarsely grated
    - 1/2 cup buttermilk, room temperature
- dry ingredients
    - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
    - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    - 1 teaspoon ground ginger
    - 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
    - 1 teaspoon baking powder
    - 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt
    - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- wet ingredients
    - 2 large eggs, room temperature
    - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
    - 6 Tablespoons (3/8 cup) (packed) dark brown sugar
    - 1 teaspoons vanilla extract

### Frosting Ingredients

- 6 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
- 6 Tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Generous pinch of kosher salt
- 2 cups powdered sugar

## Directions

1. **Night before**: Put out butter and cream cheese to let them come to room temperature.
2. **Preheat oven** to 350F and **prepare pans** with parchment rounds and oil spray.
3. **Soak raisins** in bourbon over low heat for a few minutes. Set aside and continue to soak while you do the rest of the stuff.
4. **Toast pecans** at 350F until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
5. **Grate carrots** into a medium bowl. Add buttermilk to carrots. Set aside.
6. **Prepare dry ingredients** by combining flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl.
7. **Prepare wet ingredients** by beating eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a stand mixer until pale and thick, about 4 minutes.
8. **Combine ingredients.** Reduce stand mixer to medium-low and gradually stream in oil. Add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with carrot mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients; mix until smooth.
9. **Fold in raisins and pecans** with a rubber spatula. Scrape batter into prepared pans.
10. **Bake** for 35-45 minutes, rotating halfway through, until a tester comes out clean.

### Frosting Directions

1. Using an electric hand mixer (not a stand mixer) on high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla extract and salt.
2. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in powdered sugar. Increase speed to high and beat frosting until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

Mom and I made this today, and we should really cut the recipe in half next time. As such, I updated the recipe to use two 6" cake pans and half of everything else. There were a few things that didn't halve nicely:

- "3/4 teaspoon baking soda" should've become 3/8, but I rounded up to 1/2
- "3/4 cup dark brown sugar" could've become either 3/8 cup or 6 Tablespoons, so I notated both
- "3/4 cup vegetable oil" could've become either 3/8 cup or 6 Tablespoons, so I notated both

We also used pecans instead of walnuts and bourbon instead of run - both of which worked perfectly well. I updated the recipe with these alterations, and I generally rewrote it for clarity and conciseness.
