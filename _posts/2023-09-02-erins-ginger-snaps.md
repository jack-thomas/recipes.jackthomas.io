## Ingredients

- 3 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoons salt
- 3 Tablespoons ground ginger
- 2 Tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 3 Tablespoons ground cloves
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup dark molasses (better if you get the strong flavor)
- 4 1/2 cup flour

## Directions

1. Mix the butter, both sugars, baking soda, and salt. Add in the ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix well.
2. Add in the eggs and dark molasses. Mix well. Add flour one cup at a time, mixing well with each addition.
3. Chill in fridge for at least 4 hours. This is key, otherwise the molasses will run. After chilling, leave out at room temperature for 30-60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350.
4. Scoop out cookies approximately 2 Tablespoons each, optionally onto parchment paper. Bake for 9-10 min.
