## Ingredients

### Cookie Ingredients

- 1 cup butter flavored shortening
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 cup sour cream
- 5 to 6 fresh lemons

### Glaze Ingredients

- 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 2 Tablespoons softened butter
- Rind of 2 to 3 lemons
- Juice of 2 to 3 lemons plus remainder

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Grate the rind of 2 to 3 lemons, and squeeze enough of the lemons to create 1/4 cup of juice. Save the extra juice for icing.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4. Cream shortening and sugar.
5. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well until incorporated.
6. Add lemon juice and grated rind.
7. Add mixed dry ingredients alternating with sour cream. Dough will be soft and sticky.
8. Drop 1 teaspoon per cookie onto ungreased cookie sheet.
9. Bake at 350F for 10-13 minutes, until the bottoms are golden. Let cool on a rack.
10. Make glaze. Mix powdered sugar, butter, and enough lemon juice to make a thin but hearty glaze. Dip cookie tops into glaze and let dry.
