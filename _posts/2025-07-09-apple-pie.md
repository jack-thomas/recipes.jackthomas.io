The original amount of topping was slightly too much last time I made this (although I didn't not the date), so I reduced it from 3/4 cup of each dry ingredient to 1/2 cup (i.e., resulting in 2/3 of the original recipe). I did not alter the amount of baking powder or baking soda, which should be fine, right?
