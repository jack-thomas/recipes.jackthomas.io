## Ingredients

### Cookie Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter (softened)
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 2 3/4 cup flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar (for less tang, use 1 teaspoon)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon salt

### Cinnamon-Sugar Ingredients

- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 Tablespoons cinnamon

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer.
3. Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.
4. In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.
5. If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Roll into small balls until round and smooth. Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.
6. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.

## Notes

- To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.

We baked a practice round of these today.

- Used small/size 60 scoop and then double rolled, as directed. (Did not press!) We also added a tiny sprinkle beyond that on top, but this was actually not desirable.
- Made about four dozen, so you should therefore probably double.
- Ended up baking for 11 minutes at 350 (non-convection).
