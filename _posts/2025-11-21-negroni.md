## Ingredients

- 1 ounce gin, preferably Norseman "Norseman Strength" Gin
- 1 ounce Campari
- 1 ounce sweet vermouth, preferably Carpano "Antica Formula" Sweet Vermouth

## Directions

Spray (or rinse) a chilled coupe with absinthe. Add gin, Campari, and vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until chilled. Strain into coupe and serve "up."

## Sources

Jack Thomas' preferred build for the classic cocktail. The absinthe rinse is option, of course, but I like it.
