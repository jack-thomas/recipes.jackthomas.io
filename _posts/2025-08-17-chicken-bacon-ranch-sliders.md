## Ingredients

### Filling Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked and crumbled bacon
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup prepared ranch dressing
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp dried dill
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 3 cups cooked and shredded chicken (from 1 rotisserie chicken)

### Slider Ingredients

- 12 Hawaiian rolls

### Garlic Butter Ingredients

- 1/3 cup melted butter salted or unsalted
- 3/4 tsp garlic powder
- minced fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. (Prepare) Preheat oven to 350F. Line a 9x13 pan with foil or parchment paper, and spray lightly with cooking spray. Slice rolls if necessary.
2. (Filling) To a large mixing bowl, add all filling ingredients except the chicken (bacon, cheese, ranch, mayo, garlic powder, onion powder, dill, salt, and pepper). Stir well to combine. Add chicken and toss until well coated.
3. (Assembly) Keep the buns/rolls connected to each other (on the top and bottom halves). Add the bottom section of the rolls to the prepared baking pan, cut side up. Spread the chicken filling evenly over the tops of the cut rolls. Add the top sections of the rolls, cut side down.
4. (Garlic Butter) In a small bowl, combine the melted butter with garlic powder. Brush or pour topping over the sliders.
5. (Bake) Cover Cover with foil and bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then uncover and bake another 10 minutes, until as golden brown and crispy as youâ€™d like.
