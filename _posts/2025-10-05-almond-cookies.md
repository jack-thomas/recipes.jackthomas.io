We baked a practice round of these today.

- Used small/size 60 scoop, and then rolled and pressed with flat bottom of cup.
- Makes about three dozen, so definitely double. You might want to mix two separate batches, though, so that it mixes up more easily.
- Ended up baking for 9 minutes at 350 (non-convection).
- Put glaze in baggie, cut corner to create tip, and lightly zig-zag. Don't over-glaze. Include the almond slices in the next test batch.
