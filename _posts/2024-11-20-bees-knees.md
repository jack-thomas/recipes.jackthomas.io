The previous comments don't really explain how we arrived at the build currently noted herein, but we've made a **ton** of these, so I can certainly say I'm confident in this build.

This is also good with lime juice, but that does basically just make it a [gimlet](/gimlet.html).

This cocktail worked as a good way to drink up the Bacardi Limon Flavored Rum that you had, since it gets mostly hidden.

As I reflect back on this drink (having made it again a few nights ago but not taken any notes), I'm going to have to increase it to a five star drink. It's really well-balanced and a super easy summer drink. It might even drink too easy.

The palate seems to proceed from the lemon to the honey to the gin.

I made this tonight, and it was pretty good. The gin *really* shines through (in a good way), so it seems like it's likely important to use a high quality gin. Thankfully, I used the [SMWSA Pollinator (Cask GN5.3) Scottish Gin](https://newmake.smwsa.com/products/cask-no-gn5-3) (from Glenrinnes distillery), so this turned out quite good. The first sip was quite sour, but after a few more sips, the flavors really balanced each other out. The honey and the lemon (i.e., sweet and sour) really balanced each other nicely, which allowed the flowery flavors of the gin to shine through. The juniper of the gin was super subtle, but I think that's more of a feature of the gin than of the drink.

I made a second one - this time with Beefeater. Beefeater is a middle tier gin (nothing special, solid rail gin) that's much more in the London Dry style (i.e., with more forward juniper). I also used more honey syrup (3/4oz). It was actually better this way, with all of the flavors "turned up". I could actually taste the honey, but it was still well-balanced against the lemon. The juniper-forward London Dry style gin also stood up against the honey and lemon better than the more flowery gin in the previous version.
