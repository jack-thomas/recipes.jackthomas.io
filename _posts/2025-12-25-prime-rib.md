[Greg's Meats (Hampton, MN)](https://gregsmeats.com/products) provided these instructions with their prime rib, but the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/0Y_pi4sFir4) of Greg's Twin Cities Live appearance is also quite helpful.

Mike got a 12.2-pound prime rib this year, and it only took 3 hours to get to 120F (where we pulled it). It was cooked perfectly to our liking, but it makes me believe that the suggested cooking times are targeting a much further doneness than we want.
