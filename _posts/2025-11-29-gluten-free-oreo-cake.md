## Ingredients

### Cake Ingredients

- [King Arthur Gluten-Free Yellow Cake Mix](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/gluten-free-yellow-cake-mix)
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
- 5 large eggs (yes, one more than the box calls for)
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 (3.4 ounce) box instant vanilla pudding
- [Gluten-Free Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-gluten-free)

### Frosting Ingredients

- 6 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
- 6 Tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Generous pinch of kosher salt
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- [Gluten-Free Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-gluten-free)

## Directions

1. Follow the directions on the box to make the cake, but also add an extra egg (as specified on this page), add a box of instant vanilla pudding, and crush some oreos into the cake.
2. Make cream cheese frosting, and crush some oreos into that too.

## Notes

- King Arthur's gluten-free cake mix is specifically requested for this recipe, because Pillsbury's gluten-free cake mix doesn't work as well.
