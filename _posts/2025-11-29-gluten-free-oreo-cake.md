## Ingredients

### Cake Ingredients

- [King Arthur Gluten-Free Yellow Cake Mix](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/gluten-free-yellow-cake-mix)
- 1/2 cup butter
- 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
- 5 large eggs (yes, one more than the box calls for)
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 (3.4 ounce) box instant vanilla pudding
- [Gluten-Free Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-gluten-free)

### Frosting Ingredients

- 6 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
- 6 Tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Generous pinch of kosher salt
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- [Gluten-Free Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-gluten-free)

## Directions

1. Follow the directions on the box to make the cake, but also add an extra egg (as specified on this page), add a box of instant vanilla pudding, and crush some oreos into the cake.
2. Make cream cheese frosting, and crush some oreos into that too.

## Notes

- King Arthur's gluten-free cake mix is specifically requested for this recipe, because Pillsbury's gluten-free cake mix doesn't work as well.

Rita Brown > Jack Thomas

Rita Brown described this recipe to me (Jack Thomas) in general terms, saying "Use the King Arthur gluten-free cake mix, but add an extra egg, instant pudding, and some crushed oreos. Definitely use the King Arthur one, though, because the Pillsbury one isn't as good. Then make cream cheese frosting, and crush some oreos into that too." I like the [cream cheese frosting](/cream-cheese-frosting.html) from the [carrot cake](/carrot-cake.html) that I make, so I copied that one here.
