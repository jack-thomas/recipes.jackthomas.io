## Ingredients

- 4 pints fresh blueberries, rinsed, drained
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 cup raw or granulated sugar, plus more for crust
- 1 egg
- 2 pie crusts (one for bottom, one for lattice)

## Directions

1. Toss blueberries, corn starch, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and sugar in large bowl. Let sit 30 minutes to soften berries and extract juices.
2. Preheat oven to 425 F. Place foil-lined baking sheet on center rack in oven (while preheating, that is).
3. Let crust sit at room temperature 5 minutes to soften. Roll out first crust, place into deep dish pie dish, and trim (leaving ~1/2" overhang). Roll out second crust, and cut into 1" strips (~12 strips). Pour filling into pie dish, smooth top, and top with lattice of prepared crust strips (trimming again and tucking ends under bottom crust).
4. Prepare egg wash by combining 1 egg with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. Brush edges and lattice lightly with egg wash, then sprinkle surface with sugar.
5. Optionally, chill pie in freezer for 10 minutes (perhaps while oven is preheating).
6. Place pie on preheated baking sheet. Bake pie 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 375 F. Continue to bake, checking at the 60- and 75-minute mark and loosely tenting with foil if browning too quickly, until crust is deep golden brown and juices are thick and vigorously bubbling, 75–90 minutes total (juices will start to bubble at around 75 minutes but will thicken and bubble faster in the last 15 minutes; don’t be tempted to pull it out until bubbles are really going). The internal temperature should reach 213 F.
7. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before serving. The internal temperature should be no more than 85 F when you cut into the pie.
