1. Place a cup under the spout.
2. There are four buttons on the machine. Let's call them (counterclockwise from top right) "power", "cup", "water", and "steam". Turn on the power, cup, and water buttons to make sure the water's ready to heat. Turn off the water button, dump the water out, and rinse and dry the cup.
3. Put the basket in the portafilter, place it in the grinder, and start the grinder. There's a button at the back that gets pressed automatically when you insert the portafilter, but you can also just use the main start button.
4. Tamp the espresso in the portafilter.
5. Place the portafilter in the espresso machine.
6. Once the temperature hits 200, press the "run program" button - the second button from the left on the PID (the little thing sticking out on the bottom right). It will automatically run a program that pre-infuses for two seconds, rests for two seconds, and then pulls the shot for 24-30 seconds.
7. Remove the portafilter from the espresso machine, knock out the grounds, and clean out the portafilter.
